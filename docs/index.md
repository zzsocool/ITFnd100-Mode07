#       Binary File and Error Handling

## Introduction:
```
In this week, I learned about how to create and unpack binary files and how to use expect and extract the error messages and custom the error messages to display to the user. I also learned a little more about how to edit my Github page.
```


Script:

For this week assignment, I started with creating a binary file. Binary file mode was different than normal text file. For writing mode, I input “wb”. For writing a binary file, I used pickle.dump() as shown in figure 1.
